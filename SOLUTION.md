# Design decisions

# Frameworks
Gradle build tool - Since all projects I've worked on have used Amazon's own internal build systems, this was the closest thing I could find to that. It should simplify the building process.

# Resources
[This](https://picocli.info/) is the documentation around the pico framework that I used while coding. 
[This](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/distribution_plugin.html#distribution_plugin) documentation discusses how gradle can make an easily runable executable (instead of running the raw gradle or java command each time the the user wants to use the tool).
